# Description

The folder 'ProjectGrammar' contains a JavaCC/JJTree project to create a syntax and semantics analyzer compiler.

This compiler use an example file 'program.language' to understand how a program is formed in this language.

Different objects type are then available in this language : 'int', 'real', 'boolean' and 'string'.



### Language

You can use the file 'Syntax.txt' to understand how write correctly (in the syntax sense) a program.


### To improve

This project is only analyzing syntax and semantics. Execution is the next step.

We are considering adding new types in the future.


The branches choice can be corrupted while trying to use a boolean or string value. (Check how to improve JavaCC choices)
